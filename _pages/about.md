<!-- Write from here your page !!! -->

I am Etienne and I work as a "Site Reliability Engineer".


<p><br /></p>
When I was young, my dream was to become a secret agent; After the realization set in that I am not on the path to become that famous secret agent, I started to study System Engineering. Now, I am part of an amazing and smart team, contributing in the big IT world. Ones of my favorite things are investigating possible attacks on the system and automate tasks.

<p><br /></p>
When I am not working, I am usually watching videos on YouTube (mostly landings and takeoffs - I enjoy watching everything about airports and planes), movies on Netflix or taking a look at my social media (mostly Twitter).

<p><br /></p>
I love traveling, learning new things and meeting people (by the way, I am everybody's friend)!
