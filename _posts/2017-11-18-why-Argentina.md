People are usually asking me why I chose Argentina..,
<br/>
Honestly, I had known about Argentina, not only because of Maradona and Messi but, because of BOCA JR. which club I am a great fan of since I was a child. But, I had never thought about moving to Argentina until I overhead a conversation between mom and a friend.
<br/><br/>
Something is sure, I always wanted to study on a campus, far away of my country, knowing new people, being part of a new culture... so, my family was planning to send me to the US. I was like, "ok, let's do it" but, since I have aunts, uncles and cousins over there I thought they would want to have eyes on me (Haitian parents affair).
<br/><br/>
When I overhead that in Argentina, I can study for free (I googled it to confirm) and people is awesome in Argentina, It was just what I wanted. New language, new culture, new everything... what a good adventure. It was happening in the last days of May by June the 13 (same year) I was landing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
<br/><br/>

Yeah, I know, you are thinking about how crazy I am. I swear, it is one of my biggest adventures.
<br/><br/>

Even that I am still learning about Argentina (it is that much that you cannot learn it in 6 years), I am happy to be part of this country, to be now an official Argentinean citizen.
